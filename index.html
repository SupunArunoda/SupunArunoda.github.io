<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Cytoscape</h2>

<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Cytoscape</a> is an open source tool for visualizing network with any type of data. I worked with <a href="http://nrnb.org/">National Resource for Network Biology</a> to develop two dimensional reductions algorithms which work with the Cytoscape tool. There is a plugin called <a href="http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/cytoscape/clusterMaker2/">clusterMaker2</a> and I contributed it to develop the algorithms which have the ability to do dimensional reduction.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My Contribution</h2>

<p>Major part of my project was to develop <a href="http://mb3is.megx.net/gustame/dissimilarity-based-methods/principal-coordinates-analysis">Principal Coordinate Analysis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding">t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding</a> in clusterMaker2. I had to surf through lots of resources to figure out how these algorithms react in networks. In addition it was too hard to figure out the usage of the current API in clusterMaker2.</p>
<p>My mentor adviced me to complete algorithm parts before the mid evaluation and connect with those algorithms with cytoscape before the final evaluation.</p>

<p>Principal Coordinates Analysis depends on Gowers matrix. It uses significant memory when processing a large matrix. So it should be solved when setting up large matrixs as input.</p>


      <h2> <a id="my-experience" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My experience </h2>
<p>GSOC 2k16 was my first ever open source contribution project. It was unbeliveable that my proposal accepted. New technological exposure and understanding about network based algorithms were the most significant experience to my life. I would like to expand my sincere gratitude to my mentor for guiding through the entire project
    . His mammoth contribution through thick and through thin was my strength in this achivement. </p>
